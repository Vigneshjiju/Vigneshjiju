- Namaskaram, Hi, I’m @Vignesh BG
👀 I’m interested in C, java programming and anything that pushes the boundaries of computer science. I love exploring how low-level programming interacts with high-level systems.
🌱 I’m currently learning React.js for front-end development, and diving deep into assembly language programming to understand how processors work at the machine level and pursing degree in information scince engineering.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving C, Java, React.js, anything that bridges software. I'm open to contributing to open-source projects and innovative tech startups.
